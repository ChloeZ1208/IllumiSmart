# ECE 1778 Github Project Repository - IllumiSmart Introduction
Most people receive the majority of information through the sense of sight. Therefore,
lighting is an extremely important factor in the workplace, and poor lighting damages
workersâ€™ health, reduces productivity and leads to safety issues. Physiological requirements
of lighting are different from occupations. Due to the social distance, many people have
started to work from home. There is an increasing need for ergonomic tools that help people
improve workplace settings. Therefore, the objective of IllumiSmart is to measure and assess
the user's workplace lighting conditions and give advice regarding issues identified.
